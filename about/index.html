<p>Since 2008 I work at <a href="https://axinom.com">Axinom</a>, a company that creates solutions for in-flight entertainment and online streaming. In my role as advisor I deal with a wide range of topics including:</p>

<ul>
<li>technical product design and information architecture</li>
<li>designing modern adaptive streaming workflows, from encoding and packaging to delivery and player integration</li>
<li>achieving Hollywood-grade content security in line with <a href="https://www.mpaa.org/what-we-do/advancing-creativity/additional-resources/#content-protection-best-practices">MPAA best practices</a></li>
<li>contributing to industry specifications on media streaming technologies</li>
<li>understanding performance bottlenecks and optimizing systems on architecture, operating system, database and algorithm levels</li>
<li>mentoring colleagues in applying modern techniques and practices</li>
<li>exploratory research and development</li>
</ul>

<p>I am the maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus-net/prometheus-net">prometheus-net</a> metrics library, which I use in my daily work. <a href="https://prometheus.io">Prometheus</a> is a great solution for monitoring and metrics that often I use in order to obtain a deep understanding of the information systems I work with.</p>

<p>On my free time, I enjoy consuming books and practice cycling and archery. I believe the future of humanity is in the wide open spaces between planets and am an avid fan of the heavy-lift spaceflight industry that can open the door to our destiny. I wish I could contribute more to that industry but it falls rather far from my skillset so I remain a bystander.</p>

<p>This website is a collection of thoughts that I feel like sharing, thoughts that may prove useful to someone. The set of topics is fairly arbitrary, though I try to curate it a bit for easy readability.</p>

<p>You can contact me via <a href="mailto:sander@saares.eu">sander@saares.eu</a>.</p>
