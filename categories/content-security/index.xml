      <description>The World Wide Web Consortium has recently made a decision to publish Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) as a web standard. This has drawn criticism from many directions because EME standardizes a mechanism that is highly opaque to users, has the potential to jeopardize their privacy and brings considerable legal risk to any researchers that try to study it.
Despite this, EME is a step up in interoperability and has incorporated basic privacy-oriented features that were lacking in pre-EME technologies.</description>
